This C++ code defines a function `countBits` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a vector containing the count of set bits (1s) for each number from 0 to `n`.

Here's the explanation of the code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int n) {
        vector<int> nums(n + 1); // Initialize a vector to store the count of bits for each number from 0 to n
        nums[0] = 0; // The count of bits for 0 is 0
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            nums[i] = nums[i / 2] + i % 2;
            // The count of bits for i is the count of bits for i/2 (right shift) plus the least significant bit of i (i % 2)
        }
        
        return nums; // Return the vector containing the count of bits for each number from 0 to n
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

- The function starts by initializing a vector `nums` of size `n + 1` to store the count of bits for each number from 0 to `n`.
- It sets the count of bits for 0 to 0 (`nums[0] = 0`).
- Then, it iterates from 1 to `n`.
- For each `i`, it calculates the count of bits by adding the count of bits for `i/2` (obtained by right shifting `i`) and the least significant bit of `i` (obtained by taking the remainder of `i` divided by 2, `i % 2`).
- After iterating through all numbers from 1 to `n`, it returns the vector `nums` containing the count of bits for each number from 0 to `n`.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this function is O(n) because it iterates from 1 to `n` to calculate the count of bits for each number.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(n) because it uses an additional vector of size `n + 1` to store the count of bits for each number from 0 to `n`.

Here's the explanation of the code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0); // Initialize a vector to store the count of bits for each number from 0 to n
        dp[0] = 0; // The count of bits for 0 is 0
        if (n == 0) return dp; // If n is 0, return the initialized vector
        
        dp[1] = 1; // The count of bits for 1 is 1
        int power = 2; // Initialize power of 2
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i == power) { // If i is a power of 2
                dp[i] = 1; // Set the count of bits to 1
                power *= 2; // Update power to the next power of 2
            } else if (i % 2 == 0) { // If i is even
                dp[i] = dp[i / 2]; // The count of bits is same as i/2
            } else {
                dp[i] = dp[1] + dp[i / 2]; // The count of bits is 1 (for the least significant bit) + the count of bits for i/2
            }
        }
        return dp; // Return the vector containing the count of bits for each number from 0 to n
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

- The function initializes a vector `dp` of size `n + 1` to store the count of bits for each number from 0 to `n`.
- It sets the count of bits for 0 to 0 (`dp[0] = 0`).
- If `n` is 0, it returns the initialized vector.
- It sets the count of bits for 1 to 1 (`dp[1] = 1`).
- It then iterates from 2 to `n`.
- For each `i`:
  - If `i` is a power of 2, it sets the count of bits to 1 and updates the power of 2.
  - If `i` is even, it sets the count of bits to the count of bits of `i/2`.
  - If `i` is odd, it sets the count of bits to 1 (for the least significant bit) plus the count of bits of `i/2`.
- After iterating through all numbers from 2 to `n`, it returns the vector `dp` containing the count of bits for each number from 0 to `n`.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this function is O(n) because it iterates from 2 to `n` to calculate the count of bits for each number.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(n) because it uses an additional vector of size `n + 1` to store the count of bits for each number from 0 to `n`.
