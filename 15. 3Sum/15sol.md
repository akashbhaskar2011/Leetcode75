Certainly! Let's break down the solution step-by-step and explain the intuition behind it, along with detailed comments in the code.

### Intuition

The problem is to find all unique triplets in the array that sum up to zero. To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a combination of sorting and the two-pointer technique. Here's the step-by-step intuition:

1. **Sort the array**: Sorting helps in easily skipping duplicates and using the two-pointer technique to find the triplets.
2. **Iterate through the array**: We fix one element and then use the two-pointer technique to find the other two elements that sum up to zero with the fixed element.
3. **Skip duplicates**: To avoid duplicate triplets, we skip duplicate elements for both the fixed element and while adjusting the pointers.
4. **Two-pointer technique**: For the two-pointer technique, we use one pointer starting just after the fixed element and another pointer starting from the end of the array. Depending on the sum, we move the pointers inward to find the triplet.

### Code Explanation with Comments

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Resultant vector to store the triplets
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        
        // Step 1: Sort the array to apply two-pointer technique and handle duplicates easily
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        // Step 2: Traverse the array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            // Skip duplicate elements to avoid duplicate triplets
            if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1])
                continue;

            // Two pointers, one starting just after the current element, and one from the end of the array
            int j = i + 1;
            int k = nums.size() - 1;

            // Step 3: Use two-pointer technique to find the other two elements
            while (j < k) {
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k];

                if (sum == 0) {
                    // Found a triplet that sums to zero
                    ans.push_back({nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]});

                    // Move both pointers inward to find the next potential triplet
                    j++;
                    k--;

                    // Skip duplicates for the second element
                    while (j < k && nums[j] == nums[j - 1]) {
                        j++;
                    }
                    // Skip duplicates for the third element
                    while (j < k && nums[k] == nums[k + 1]) {
                        k--;
                    }
                } else if (sum > 0) {
                    // If the sum is greater than zero, move the right pointer to decrease the sum
                    k--;
                } else {
                    // If the sum is less than zero, move the left pointer to increase the sum
                    j++;
                }
            }
        }
        // Return the list of triplets
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Key Points

1. **Sorting the array**: `sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());`
   - This makes it easier to skip duplicates and efficiently find the two elements that sum to the target using the two-pointer technique.

2. **Skipping duplicates**:
   - Before entering the two-pointer loop: `if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) continue;`
   - Inside the two-pointer loop, after finding a valid triplet: 
     - `while (j < k && nums[j] == nums[j - 1]) j++;`
     - `while (j < k && nums[k] == nums[k + 1]) k--;`

3. **Two-pointer technique**:
   - Initialize pointers: `int j = i + 1; int k = nums.size() - 1;`
   - Adjust pointers based on the sum of the triplet:
     - Move both pointers inward if a valid triplet is found.
     - Move the right pointer left if the sum is greater than zero.
     - Move the left pointer right if the sum is less than zero.

By following these steps, we efficiently find all unique triplets that sum to zero while avoiding duplicates.
