Below is the provided C++ code snippet with added comments:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Recursive helper function to find combinations
    void helper(vector<int> can, int target, vector<int>& com, vector<vector<int>>& ans, int i) {
        // Base case: if we have iterated through all candidates
        if (i == can.size()) {
            // If target is reached, add the combination to the answer
            if (target == 0)
                ans.push_back(com);
            return;
        }
        
        // Include the current candidate and recursively explore further
        if (target >= can[i]) {
            com.push_back(can[i]); // Include the current candidate in the combination
            helper(can, target - can[i], com, ans, i); // Recursive call with updated target
            com.pop_back(); // Backtrack: remove the last candidate from the combination
        }
        
        // Exclude the current candidate and recursively explore further
        helper(can, target, com, ans, i + 1); // Recursive call with next candidate
    }

    // Function to find all combinations that sum up to the target
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum(vector<int>& candidates, int target) {
        vector<vector<int>> ans; // Vector to store all combinations
        vector<int> com; // Vector to store a single combination
        
        // Call the helper function to find combinations
        helper(candidates, target, com, ans, 0);
        
        return ans; // Return the list of combinations
    }
};
```

### Intuition and Approach:
This function aims to find all combinations of numbers from the given candidates that sum up to the target. It utilizes backtracking to explore all possible combinations.

### Steps:
1. Define a helper function `helper` to recursively find combinations:
   - Base case: If we have iterated through all candidates (`i == can.size()`):
     - If the target is reached (`target == 0`), add the current combination to the answer.
     - Return to backtrack.
   - Include the current candidate and recursively explore further:
     - If the current candidate is less than or equal to the remaining target, include it in the combination.
     - Recursively call the function with the updated target.
     - Backtrack by removing the last candidate from the combination.
   - Exclude the current candidate and recursively explore further:
     - Recursively call the function with the next candidate.
2. Initialize an empty vector `ans` to store all combinations.
3. Initialize an empty vector `com` to store a single combination.
4. Call the helper function with the candidates, target, an empty combination, and the starting index 0.
5. Return the list of combinations stored in `ans`.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time complexity:** The time complexity depends on the number of combinations generated. In the worst case, it is exponential, as each candidate has two choices (to include or exclude) for each recursive call.
- **Space complexity:** The space complexity depends on the number of recursive calls and the size of the combinations stored in the answer. It is also exponential in the worst case.
