Below are the provided code snippets with added comments for intuition, approach, and complexity analysis:

### Using Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming Approach:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 3)
            return n; // Base cases for n <= 3
        
        long int dp[46]; // Initialize an array to store the number of ways to climb stairs
        dp[1] = 1; // Base case for n = 1
        dp[2] = 2; // Base case for n = 2
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]; // Compute the number of ways to climb stairs using previous values
        }
        return dp[n]; // Return the number of ways to climb n stairs
    }
};
```

### Using Space-Optimized Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming Approach:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 3)
            return n; // Base cases for n <= 3
        
        int first = 2; // Initialize the number of ways to climb stairs for n = 2
        int second = 3; // Initialize the number of ways to climb stairs for n = 3
        int total = 0; // Initialize the total number of ways
        
        for (int i = 4; i <= n; ++i) {
            total = first + second; // Compute the total number of ways for current n
            first = second; // Update the number of ways for n - 1
            second = total; // Update the number of ways for n - 2
        }

        return total; // Return the total number of ways to climb n stairs
    }
};
```

### Using Recursion with Memoization (Top-Down) Approach:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 3)
            return n; // Base cases for n <= 3
        
        return climbStairs(n - 1) + climbStairs(n - 2); // Recursively compute the number of ways to climb n stairs
    }
};
```

### Intuition and Approach:

All three implementations aim to compute the number of ways to climb \( n \) stairs efficiently.

1. **Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming Approach:** It iterates from 3 to \( n \) and computes the number of ways to climb stairs iteratively using previous values stored in the dp array.

2. **Space-Optimized Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming Approach:** It iterates from 4 to \( n \) and computes the number of ways to climb stairs iteratively using two variables to store the number of ways for the previous two stairs.

3. **Recursion with Memoization (Top-Down) Approach:** It uses recursion with memoization. The function recursively computes the number of ways to climb stairs for \( n \) using previous values.

### Complexity:

- **Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming Approach:**
  - Time complexity: \( O(n) \) - Iterating from 3 to \( n \) to compute the number of ways to climb stairs.
  - Space complexity: \( O(n) \) - Dynamic programming array to store computed values.

- **Space-Optimized Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming Approach:**
  - Time complexity: \( O(n) \) - Iterating from 4 to \( n \) to compute the number of ways to climb stairs.
  - Space complexity: \( O(1) \) - Constant space, as only a few variables are used.

- **Recursion with Memoization (Top-Down) Approach:**
  - Time complexity: \( O(2^n) \) - Exponential time complexity due to the recursive calls.
  - Space complexity: \( O(n) \) - Memoization array to store computed values.
