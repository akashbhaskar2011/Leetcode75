Sure, I'll explain the line `((n & 0xF0) >> 4 | (n & 0x0F) << 4)` and why we use `0xF0` and `0x0F`.

### Explanation of the Line

This line of code is used to swap the nibbles of an 8-bit number `n`.

- **Nibbles**: A nibble is a four-bit aggregation, or half an octet (an 8-bit byte). There are two nibbles in a byte: the high nibble and the low nibble.
- **High nibble**: The leftmost four bits of an 8-bit byte.
- **Low nibble**: The rightmost four bits of an 8-bit byte.

### Breakdown of the Expression

1. **`n & 0xF0`**:
   - `0xF0` in binary is `11110000`.
   - `n & 0xF0` extracts the high nibble (the leftmost 4 bits) of `n`.
   - For example, if `n = 10101100` (in binary), then `n & 0xF0` results in `10100000`.

2. **`(n & 0xF0) >> 4`**:
   - This shifts the extracted high nibble right by 4 bits.
   - For example, `10100000 >> 4` results in `00001010`.

3. **`n & 0x0F`**:
   - `0x0F` in binary is `00001111`.
   - `n & 0x0F` extracts the low nibble (the rightmost 4 bits) of `n`.
   - For example, if `n = 10101100` (in binary), then `n & 0x0F` results in `00001100`.

4. **`(n & 0x0F) << 4`**:
   - This shifts the extracted low nibble left by 4 bits.
   - For example, `00001100 << 4` results in `11000000`.

5. **Combining both parts with OR `|`**:
   - `((n & 0xF0) >> 4) | ((n & 0x0F) << 4)`
   - This combines the shifted high nibble (now in the position of the low nibble) with the shifted low nibble (now in the position of the high nibble).
   - For example, combining `00001010` and `11000000` results in `11001010`.

### Why Use `0xF0` and `0x0F`

- **Hexadecimal notation (0x)**: This is a convenient way to represent binary numbers in a compact form. Each hex digit represents 4 binary digits (bits).
- **`0xF0` (11110000 in binary)**: This is used to isolate the high nibble of an 8-bit number.
- **`0x0F` (00001111 in binary)**: This is used to isolate the low nibble of an 8-bit number.

By using these masks (`0xF0` and `0x0F`), we can easily extract and manipulate the nibbles of an 8-bit number.

### Summary

The line `((n & 0xF0) >> 4 | (n & 0x0F) << 4)`:
1. Extracts the high nibble of `n` and shifts it to the right by 4 bits.
2. Extracts the low nibble of `n` and shifts it to the left by 4 bits.
3. Combines these two results using the bitwise OR operator to produce the final result where the nibbles of `n` have been swapped.
