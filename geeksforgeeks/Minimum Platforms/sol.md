The provided code defines a solution to find the minimum number of platforms required at a railway station such that no train has to wait. The approach uses sorting and a two-pointer technique to solve the problem efficiently. Below is a detailed explanation of the code:

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting Arrival and Departure Arrays**:
   - First, we sort the `arr` (arrival times) and `dep` (departure times) arrays.
   - Sorting is essential because it allows us to process events (arrival or departure) in chronological order.

2. **Using Two Pointers**:
   - We use two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse the `arr` and `dep` arrays respectively.
   - `i` points to the current arrival time and `j` points to the current departure time.

3. **Platform Count Logic**:
   - We initialize `platformneeded` to 1 because at least one platform is needed for the first train.
   - `result` keeps track of the maximum number of platforms needed at any time.
   - We traverse the sorted arrival and departure arrays:
     - If the current train's arrival time (`arr[i]`) is less than or equal to the current train's departure time (`dep[j]`), it means a new train is arriving before the previous one departs. Thus, we increment the platform count.
     - If the current train's arrival time (`arr[i]`) is greater than the current train's departure time (`dep[j]`), it means the current train can use the platform of the train that just departed. Thus, we decrement the platform count.
   - After each iteration, we update the `result` to be the maximum of `result` and `platformneeded`.

4. **Result**:
   - The value of `result` after processing all arrival and departure times gives the minimum number of platforms required.

### Code:

Here is the provided code with comments for clarity:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Class Solution containing the findPlatform function
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find the minimum number of platforms required at the railway station
    int findPlatform(int arr[], int dep[], int n) {
        // Sorting the arrival and departure arrays
        sort(arr, arr + n);
        sort(dep, dep + n);

        // Initializing platform needed and result
        int platformneeded = 1; // At least one platform is needed initially
        int result = 1;
        int i = 1, j = 0; // Starting pointers for arrival and departure arrays

        // Traversing the sorted arrival and departure arrays
        while (i < n && j < n) {
            // If next train arrives before or when the current train departs
            if (arr[i] <= dep[j]) {
                platformneeded++;
                i++;
            }
            // If next train arrives after the current train departs
            else {
                platformneeded--;
                j++;
            }
            // Updating result with the maximum number of platforms needed
            result = max(result, platformneeded);
        }
        return result; // Returning the result
    }
};

// Main function to test the findPlatform function
int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t; // Number of test cases
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n; // Number of trains
        int arr[n]; // Arrival times array
        int dep[n]; // Departure times array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            cin >> arr[i];
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            cin >> dep[j];

        Solution ob;
        // Printing the result for each test case
        cout << ob.findPlatform(arr, dep, n) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Sorting** ensures that events are processed in chronological order.
- **Two-pointer technique** efficiently manages the platform count by considering the next event (arrival or departure).
- The time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to sorting, and the space complexity is \(O(1)\) if sorting in-place, making this approach efficient.
