Below are the commented versions of both provided codes:

    // The goal is to find the length of the longest subarray containing only 1s and at most one 0.
    // We maintain two pointers, 'p' and 'n', representing the count of consecutive 1s and 0s respectively.
    // We iterate through the 'nums' array and update 'p' and 'n' accordingly.
    // Whenever 'p' becomes zero, we move 'i' until we find the next '1'.
    // After finding consecutive '1's, we update 'p' and 'n' and update 'ans' with the maximum value of 'ans' and 'p+n'.
    // We repeat this process until the end of the array.
    // Finally, we return 'ans', which represents the length of the longest valid subarray.
