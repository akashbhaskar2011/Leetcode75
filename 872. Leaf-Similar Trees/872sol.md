Below is the provided code with comments added to explain its functionality and the algorithm it implements:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> v1; // Vector to store leaf node values of the first tree
    vector<int> v2; // Vector to store leaf node values of the second tree

    // Function to get leaf nodes of a binary tree and store them in a vector
    void getLeafNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<int> &v) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            return;

        // Check if the node is a leaf node (no left and right children)
        if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr)
            v.push_back(root->val); // Store the value of the leaf node in the vector
        else {
            // Recursively traverse left and right subtrees to get leaf nodes
            getLeafNodes(root->left, v);
            getLeafNodes(root->right, v);
        }
    }

    // Function to check if two binary trees have similar leaf sequences
    bool leafSimilar(TreeNode* root1, TreeNode* root2) {
        // Get leaf nodes of both trees and store them in respective vectors
        getLeafNodes(root1, v1);
        getLeafNodes(root2, v2);

        // If the sizes of the leaf node vectors are different, trees are not leaf-similar
        if (v1.size() != v2.size())
            return false;

        // Iterate through the leaf node vectors and check if corresponding values are equal
        for (int i = 0; i < v1.size(); i++) {
            if (v1[i] != v2[i])
                return false; // If values are not equal, trees are not leaf-similar
        }

        // If all leaf node values are equal, trees are leaf-similar
        return true;
    }
};
```

**Explanation:**

1. The `TreeNode` struct defines the structure of a binary tree node with an integer value (`val`) and pointers to its left and right children.

2. The `Solution` class contains a method `leafSimilar` which checks if two given binary trees have similar leaf sequences.

3. The `getLeafNodes` function recursively traverses the binary tree and collects the values of leaf nodes into a vector passed by reference.

4. In the `leafSimilar` function, leaf nodes of both trees are collected using `getLeafNodes` and stored in vectors `v1` and `v2`.

5. If the sizes of the leaf node vectors are different, the trees are not leaf-similar.

6. If the sizes are equal, it iterates through the leaf node vectors and checks if corresponding leaf node values are equal. If any values differ, the trees are not leaf-similar. Otherwise, they are leaf-similar.

7. The function returns `true` if the trees are leaf-similar, otherwise it returns `false`.
