Below is the provided code with added comments for intuition, approach, and complexity analysis:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> rightSideView(TreeNode* root) {
        queue<TreeNode*> q; // Initialize a queue for level order traversal
        if(!root) { // If the tree is empty, return an empty vector
            return {};
        }
        q.push(root); // Push the root node into the queue
        vector<int> res; // Initialize a vector to store the right side view values
        int value; // Initialize a variable to store the value of the rightmost node at each level
        while(!q.empty()) { // Continue traversal until the queue is empty
            int s = q.size(); // Get the current size of the queue, which represents the number of nodes at the current level
            for(int i = 0; i < s; i++) { // Process all nodes at the current level
                TreeNode* node = q.front(); // Get the front node of the queue
                value = node->val; // Update the value of the rightmost node at the current level
                q.pop(); // Remove the front node from the queue

                // Enqueue the children of the current node if they exist
                if(node->left) {
                    q.push(node->left);
                }
                if(node->right) {
                    q.push(node->right);
                }
            }
            res.push_back(value); // Push the value of the rightmost node at the current level into the result vector
        }
        return res; // Return the vector containing the right side view values
    }
};
```

## Intuition
The problem aims to find the right side view of a binary tree, which is the set of nodes visible from the right side when the tree is viewed from top to bottom.

## Approach
1. We perform a level order traversal (BFS) of the binary tree using a queue.
2. At each level, we record the value of the last node (rightmost) encountered.
3. After traversing all levels, we have the right side view of the binary tree.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node once during the level order traversal.
- Space complexity: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the maximum number of nodes at any level in the binary tree. In the worst case, the queue can hold all nodes at the maximum level.
