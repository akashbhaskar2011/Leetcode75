Below is the breakdown of the provided C++ code snippet with added comments:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        vector<int> dp(amount + 1, amount + 1); // Initialize a DP array with values amount + 1
        dp[0] = 0; // Base case: The minimum number of coins required to make 0 amount is 0
        
        // Iterate from 1 to the given amount
        for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
            // Iterate over each coin value in the coins array
            for (int j = 0; j < coins.size(); j++) {
                // If the current coin value is less than or equal to the current amount 'i'
                if (coins[j] <= i) {
                    // Update the minimum number of coins required for the current amount 'i'
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - coins[j]]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If dp[amount] is still amount + 1, it means no combination of coins can make up the amount
        // So, return -1. Otherwise, return dp[amount].
        return dp[amount] == amount + 1 ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
};
```

### Intuition and Approach:
This function aims to find the minimum number of coins required to make up the given amount using dynamic programming. It iterates over each possible amount from 1 to the target amount and tries to find the optimal solution by considering each coin denomination.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a DP array `dp` of size `amount + 1`, where each element represents the minimum number of coins required to make up the corresponding amount.
2. Set `dp[0]` to 0, as no coins are needed to make 0 amount.
3. Iterate over each amount from 1 to `amount`:
   - For each amount `i`, iterate over each coin denomination in the `coins` array.
   - If the current coin denomination `coins[j]` is less than or equal to `i`, update `dp[i]` with the minimum of its current value and `1 + dp[i - coins[j]]`, which represents the minimum number of coins required to make up the remaining amount after considering the current coin.
4. After completing the iteration, check if `dp[amount]` is still `amount + 1`. If so, it means no combination of coins can make up the amount, so return -1. Otherwise, return `dp[amount]`, which represents the minimum number of coins required to make up the target amount.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time complexity:** O(amount * |coins|), where `amount` is the given amount and `|coins|` is the number of coin denominations. The nested loops iterate over each possible amount and each coin denomination.
- **Space complexity:** O(amount), as the DP array `dp` has a size of `amount + 1`.
