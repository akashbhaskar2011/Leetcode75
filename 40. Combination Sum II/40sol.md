Here's the provided C++ code snippet with added comments:

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    // Helper function to find combinations that sum up to the target
    void helper(int start, vector<int>& cand, int target, vector<vector<int>>& ans, vector<int>& combi) {
        // Base case: if the target is reached, add the combination to the answer
        if (target == 0) {
            ans.push_back(combi);
            return;
        }

        // Iterate over the candidates starting from 'start'
        for (int i = start; i < cand.size() && target >= cand[i]; i++) {
            // Skip duplicate candidates to avoid duplicate combinations
            if (i > start && cand[i] == cand[i - 1])
                continue;

            combi.push_back(cand[i]); // Include the current candidate in the combination
            helper(i + 1, cand, target - cand[i], ans, combi); // Recursively explore further with updated target
            combi.pop_back(); // Backtrack: remove the last candidate from the combination
        }
    }

public:
    // Function to find all unique combinations that sum up to the target
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum2(vector<int>& candidates, int target) {
        vector<vector<int>> ans; // Vector to store all combinations
        vector<int> combi; // Vector to store a single combination

        // Sort the candidates to handle duplicates
        sort(candidates.begin(), candidates.end());

        // Call the helper function to find combinations
        helper(0, candidates, target, ans, combi);

        return ans; // Return the list of combinations
    }
};
```

### Intuition and Approach:
This function aims to find all unique combinations of numbers from the given candidates that sum up to the target. It utilizes backtracking to explore all possible combinations while avoiding duplicates.

### Steps:
1. Define a helper function `helper` to recursively find combinations:
   - Base case: If the target is reached (`target == 0`), add the current combination to the answer.
   - Iterate over the candidates starting from `start`:
     - Skip duplicate candidates to avoid duplicate combinations.
     - Include the current candidate in the combination.
     - Recursively call the function with the updated target and starting index.
     - Backtrack by removing the last candidate from the combination.
2. Initialize an empty vector `ans` to store all combinations.
3. Initialize an empty vector `combi` to store a single combination.
4. Sort the candidates to handle duplicates.
5. Call the helper function with the candidates, target, an empty combination, and the starting index 0.
6. Return the list of combinations.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time complexity:** The time complexity depends on the number of combinations generated. In the worst case, it is exponential, as each candidate has two choices (to include or exclude) for each recursive call.
- **Space complexity:** The space complexity depends on the number of recursive calls and the size of the combinations stored in the answer. It is also exponential in the worst case.




This C++ code implements the `combinationSum2` function, which finds all unique combinations of candidates in the array `candidates` that sum up to `target`. Each number in `candidates` can only be used once in each combination.

Below is the explanation of the code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Recursive helper function to find all unique combinations that sum up to the target
    void helper(vector<int>& cand, int target, int i, set<vector<int>>& ans, vector<int>& comb) {
        // If we have processed all candidates or the target sum is achieved
        if (i == cand.size() || target == 0) {
            if (target == 0) // If target is achieved, add the combination to the set of answers
                ans.insert(comb);
            return;
        }
        
        // Include the current candidate if it does not exceed the target
        if (target >= cand[i]) {
            comb.push_back(cand[i]);
            helper(cand, target - cand[i], i + 1, ans, comb); // Recur with the reduced target and move to the next candidate
            comb.pop_back(); // Backtrack by removing the last element (restore the state)
        }
        
        helper(cand, target, i + 1, ans, comb); // Exclude the current candidate and move to the next candidate
    }
    
    // Function to find all unique combinations of candidates that sum up to the target
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum2(vector<int>& candidates, int target) {
        vector<int> comb; // Vector to store the current combination
        sort(candidates.begin(), candidates.end()); // Sort the candidates to handle duplicates
        
        set<vector<int>> tempAns; // Set to store temporary answers (to handle duplicates)
        vector<vector<int>> ans; // Vector to store final answers
        
        helper(candidates, target, 0, tempAns, comb); // Call the recursive helper function
        
        // Copy the answers from the set to the result vector
        for (auto i : tempAns) {
            ans.push_back(i);
        }
        
        return ans; // Return the final result
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

- The `helper` function is a recursive function that explores all possible combinations of candidates to find those that sum up to the target. It maintains a set of combinations (`ans`) to avoid duplicate combinations.
- In each recursive call, it considers including or excluding the current candidate in the combination. If including the current candidate does not exceed the target, it adds the candidate to the combination and recursively explores further. After the recursion, it removes the candidate from the combination (backtracking).
- The base cases are when either all candidates are processed (`i == cand.size()`) or the target sum is achieved (`target == 0`). In the latter case, it adds the current combination to the set of answers.
- The `combinationSum2` function sorts the candidates to handle duplicates and then calls the `helper` function to find all unique combinations.
- Finally, it copies the combinations from the set to the result vector and returns it.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is exponential, depending on the number of candidates and the target sum. However, the use of backtracking and early termination helps in reducing the search space.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity depends on the number of unique combinations found, which could be exponential in the worst case. Additionally, extra space is used for the recursive call stack.
