Sure! Let's break down the code step by step and understand the algorithm used.

### Algorithm Explanation

The goal of this algorithm is to find the number of subarrays whose sum is divisible by a given integer `k`. The algorithm utilizes the concept of prefix sums and modular arithmetic to efficiently count such subarrays.

### Steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is the size of the input array `nums`.
   - `prefixmod` is used to store the current prefix sum modulo `k`.
   - `result` stores the final count of subarrays whose sum is divisible by `k`.
   - `modgroups` is a vector of size `k` used to store the frequency of each prefix sum modulo `k`. 

2. **Prefix Sum and Modulo Calculation**:
   - For each element in `nums`, update the prefix sum and compute the modulo `k`.
   - Adjust the result of the modulo operation to ensure it's non-negative.

3. **Count Valid Subarrays**:
   - If the current `prefixmod` has been seen before (i.e., `modgroups[prefixmod]` is non-zero), it means there are previous prefix sums that, when subtracted from the current prefix sum, yield a sum that is divisible by `k`.
   - Increment the count of such valid subarrays by the frequency of the current `prefixmod`.
   - Update the frequency of the current `prefixmod` in `modgroups`.

### Code with Comments

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraysDivByK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();       // Get the size of the input array
        int prefixmod = 0;         // Initialize the prefix sum modulo k
        int result = 0;            // Initialize the result to store the count of valid subarrays

        vector<int> modgroups(k);  // Vector to store frequency of each prefix sum modulo k
        modgroups[0] = 1;          // There is one way to have a prefix sum of 0 modulo k (empty subarray)

        // Iterate over each number in the input array
        for(int num : nums) {
            // Update the prefix sum modulo k and adjust to ensure it's non-negative
            prefixmod = (prefixmod + num % k + k) % k;
            
            // Add the frequency of the current prefixmod to the result
            result += modgroups[prefixmod];
            
            // Increment the frequency of the current prefixmod
            modgroups[prefixmod]++;
        }

        return result;  // Return the count of subarrays whose sum is divisible by k
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - The algorithm iterates through the array `nums` exactly once. Each operation inside the loop (prefix sum update, modulo operation, and array access) takes constant time.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(k)\)
  - The additional space used is for the `modgroups` vector, which has a size of `k`. Other variables use constant space.

This algorithm is efficient for the given problem and provides a linear time solution with respect to the size of the input array.
