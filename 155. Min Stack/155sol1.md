Your implementation of the `MinStack` class looks good and effectively handles the requirements. Below is the detailed explanation and slight improvements for the class to make it more robust and clear.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Data Structure**:
    - You use a stack of pairs, where each pair consists of the value and the minimum value at that point in the stack.
    - This allows constant-time access to the minimum value.

2. **Constructor**:
    - Initializes an empty stack.

3. **Push Operation**:
    - If the stack is empty, the value being pushed is also the minimum.
    - Otherwise, compare the new value with the current minimum (top elementâ€™s second value in the stack) and push the new value along with the updated minimum.

4. **Pop Operation**:
    - Simply removes the top element of the stack.

5. **Top Operation**:
    - Returns the top value of the stack.
    - If the stack is empty, it returns -1.

6. **GetMin Operation**:
    - Returns the minimum value from the stack.
    - If the stack is empty, it returns -1.

### Improved Implementation

Here is the improved version with more comments for clarity and slight improvements:

```cpp
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>

class MinStack {
public:
    std::stack<std::pair<int, int>> st; // Stack to store pairs of (value, current minimum)

    MinStack() {
        // Constructor initializes an empty stack
    }
    
    void push(int val) {
        if (st.empty()) {
            // If the stack is empty, the minimum is the value being pushed
            st.push({val, val});
        } else {
            // Otherwise, the minimum is the smaller value between val and the current minimum
            int currentMin = st.top().second;
            st.push({val, std::min(val, currentMin)});
        }
    }
    
    void pop() {
        if (!st.empty()) {
            // Remove the top value from the stack
            st.pop();
        }
    }
    
    int top() {
        if (st.empty()) {
            // Return -1 if the stack is empty
            return -1;
        }
        return st.top().first; // Return the top value of the stack
    }
    
    int getMin() {
        if (st.empty()) {
            // Return -1 if the stack is empty
            return -1;
        }
        return st.top().second; // Return the current minimum value in the stack
    }
};

/**
 * Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MinStack* obj = new MinStack();
 * obj->push(val);
 * obj->pop();
 * int param_3 = obj->top();
 * int param_4 = obj->getMin();
 */
```

### Notes:
1. **Edge Case Handling**:
    - The methods `top()` and `getMin()` return -1 when the stack is empty. Depending on the requirements, you might want to handle empty cases differently, such as throwing an exception or using a different error code.
2. **Efficiency**:
    - The space complexity is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of elements in the stack, as each element is stored with its corresponding minimum. The time complexity for each operation (`push`, `pop`, `top`, `getMin`) is \(O(1)\).

This `MinStack` implementation ensures that all operations (push, pop, top, and getMin) are efficient and performed in constant time.
