Your implementation of the `nextGreaterElements` function is close to being correct, but it can be improved for clarity and efficiency. The key idea is to use a stack to find the next greater element for each element in a circular manner.

Here is a refined version of the code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> nextGreaterElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> ans(n, -1);
        stack<int> st;

        for (int i = 2 * n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int num = nums[i % n];

            while (!st.empty() && st.top() <= num) {
                st.pop();
            }

            if (i < n) {
                if (!st.empty()) {
                    ans[i] = st.top();
                }
            }

            st.push(num);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
    - The `ans` vector is initialized with `-1`, assuming no greater element exists.
    - A stack `st` is used to keep track of the next greater elements.

2. **Loop through elements**:
    - The loop runs from `2 * n - 1` to `0` to simulate the circular nature of the array.
    - `num` is assigned the value of the element at index `i % n`, which ensures that the array is accessed circularly.

3. **Maintain the stack**:
    - While the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is less than or equal to the current number, pop the stack.
    - If the current index `i` is less than `n`, we are in the first pass and should assign the next greater element to `ans[i]` if the stack is not empty.

4. **Push current number onto the stack**:
    - Push the current number onto the stack for future comparisons.

5. **Return the result**:
    - Finally, the `ans` vector containing the next greater elements is returned.

This approach efficiently handles the circular nature of the problem using a stack and ensures that each element's next greater element is correctly found.
