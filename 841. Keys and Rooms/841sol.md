Below is the provided C++ code snippet with added comments:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to check if all rooms in a set of rooms can be visited
    bool canVisitAllRooms(vector<vector<int>>& rooms) {
        // If the first room is empty, it's not possible to visit all rooms
        if (rooms[0].empty())
            return false;

        int n = rooms.size(); // Number of rooms
        vector<int> visited(n, 0); // Array to track visited rooms, initialized with zeros

        visited[0] = 1; // Mark the first room as visited
        queue<int> q; // Queue to perform BFS traversal

        // Push all the keys from the first room into the queue
        for (int key : rooms[0])
            q.push(key);

        // BFS traversal to visit all reachable rooms
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int room = q.front(); // Get the front room from the queue
            visited[room] = 1; // Mark the current room as visited
            q.pop(); // Remove the current room from the queue

            // Iterate through all the keys in the current room
            for (auto key : rooms[room]) {
                // If the key leads to an unvisited room, add it to the queue
                if (!visited[key]) {
                    q.push(key);
                }
            }
        }

        // Check if all rooms have been visited
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Output the visited status of each room
            cout << visited[i] << " ";
            // If any room remains unvisited, return false
            if (visited[i] == 0)
                return false;
        }
        
        // If all rooms have been visited, return true
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- This function aims to determine whether all rooms in a set of rooms can be visited or not.
- It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal starting from the first room (room 0).
- The function uses a queue to keep track of rooms that need to be visited.
- Initially, it pushes all the keys from the first room into the queue.
- It then iteratively pops rooms from the queue, marks them as visited, and adds their keys to the queue if those keys lead to unvisited rooms.
- Finally, it checks if all rooms have been visited. If any room remains unvisited, the function returns false; otherwise, it returns true.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(N + E), where N is the number of rooms and E is the total number of keys across all rooms. The function performs BFS traversal, visiting each room and processing its keys.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of rooms. The space complexity is determined by the visited array, which tracks the visited status of each room. Additionally, the queue may temporarily hold keys, but it doesn't affect the overall space complexity as it doesn't store keys permanently.
