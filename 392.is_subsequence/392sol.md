Certainly! Here's the commented version of both implementations:

### First Implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    // # Intuition
    // The goal is to check if string 's' is a subsequence of string 't'. We use two pointers, 'i' and 'j',
    // to iterate through 's' and 't', respectively. For each character in 't', if it matches the current
    // character in 's', we increment 'j'. At the end, if 'j' reaches the length of 's', then 's' is a subsequence
    // of 't'.

    bool isSubsequence(std::string s, std::string t) {
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); i++) {
            // If the current character in 't' matches the current character in 's', increment 'j'
            if (s[j] == t[i]) j++;
        }
        // Return true if 'j' reaches the length of 's'
        return (j == s.length());
    }
};
```

### Second Implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    // # Intuition
    // Similar to the first implementation, the goal is to check if string 's' is a subsequence of string 't'.
    // We use two pointers, 'i' and 'k', to iterate through 's' and 't', respectively. For each character in 't',
    // if it matches the current character in 's', we increment 'i'. At the end, if 'i' reaches the length of 's',
    // then 's' is a subsequence of 't'.

    bool isSubsequence(std::string s, std::string t) {
        int i = 0, k = 0, len1 = s.length(), len2 = t.length();
        while (k < len2) {
            // If the current character in 't' matches the current character in 's', increment 'i'
            if (s[i] == t[k]) {
                i++;
            }
            k++;
        }
        // Return true if 'i' reaches the length of 's'
        return (i == len1);
    }
};
```

These versions include comments explaining the intuition and approach of each implementation.
