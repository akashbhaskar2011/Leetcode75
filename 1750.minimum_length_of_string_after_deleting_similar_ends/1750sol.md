Certainly! Here's the commented version of both implementations:

### First Implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    // # Intuition
    // The goal is to find the minimum length of a string after removing some characters from both ends.
    // We use two pointers, 'i' and 'j', initialized at the beginning and end of the string, respectively.
    // In each step, if the characters at 'i' and 'j' are equal, we continue removing adjacent duplicates
    // from both ends. We increment 'i' and decrement 'j' accordingly. The process continues until 'i' becomes
    // greater than or equal to 'j'. If 'j' becomes less than 'i', it means the entire string consists of the
    // same character, and the minimum length is 0. Otherwise, we return 'j - i + 1', representing the minimum
    // length after removal.

    int minimumLength(std::string s) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = s.size() - 1;

        while (i < j) {
            if (s[i] != s[j]) break;

            // Remove adjacent duplicates from both ends
            while (i < s.length() - 1 && s[i] == s[i + 1]) i++;
            while (j >= i && s[j] == s[j - 1]) j--;

            // Move 'i' and 'j' towards the center
            i++;
            j--;
        }

        // If 'j' becomes less than 'i', the entire string consists of the same character
        if (j < i) return 0;

        // Return the minimum length after removal
        return j - i + 1;
    }
};
```

### Second Implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    // # Intuition
    // The goal is the same as the first implementation. We use two pointers, 'i' and 'j', initialized at the
    // beginning and end of the string, respectively. In each step, if the characters at 'i' and 'j' are equal,
    // we continue removing adjacent duplicates from both ends. We increment 'i' and decrement 'j' accordingly.
    // The process continues until 'i' becomes greater than or equal to 'j'. If 'j' becomes less than 'i', it
    // means the entire string consists of the same character, and the minimum length is 0. Otherwise, we return
    // 'j - i + 1', representing the minimum length after removal.

    int minimumLength(std::string s) {
        // If the length of the string is less than 1, return the length
        if (s.length() < 1) return s.length();

        int len = s.length() - 1;
        int count = 0;

        // If the first and last characters are different, return the length of the string
        if (s[0] != s[len]) return len + 1;

        int i = 0, j = len;
        while (i < j) {
            char c = s[i];

            // If the characters at 'i' and 'j' are equal, continue removing adjacent duplicates from both ends
            if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                while (s[i] == c && i <= j) {
                    count++;
                    i++;
                }
                while (s[j] == c && i <= j) {
                    count++;
                    j--;
                }
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }

        // Return the maximum of 0 and (len + 1 - count)
        return std::max(0, (len + 1 - count));
    }
};
```

These versions include comments explaining the intuition and approach of each implementation.
