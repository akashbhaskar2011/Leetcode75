Looks like there's a slight error in the function parameter name. It should be `int m` instead of `int n`. Here's the corrected version of the code along with an explanation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasAlternatingBits(int m) {
        if (m == 1) // Edge case: if m is 1, it has alternating bits
            return true;
        
        int prev = m & 1; // Get the least significant bit of m
        m = m >> 1; // Right shift m to get the next bit
        
        while (m) { // Iterate through all bits of m
            if (prev == (m & 1)) // If the current bit is equal to the previous bit, return false
                return false;
            
            prev = m & 1; // Update the previous bit
            m = m >> 1; // Right shift m to get the next bit
        }
        
        return true; // If all bits are alternating, return true
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

- The function `hasAlternatingBits` takes an integer `m` as input and returns true if `m` has alternating bits, otherwise false.
- If `m` is 1, it directly returns true because it has alternating bits.
- It starts by extracting the least significant bit of `m` and storing it in the variable `prev`.
- Then, it right shifts `m` by 1 to get the next bit.
- It enters a while loop where it iterates through all bits of `m`.
- Inside the loop, it checks if the current bit is equal to the previous bit. If yes, it means the bits are not alternating, so it returns false.
- Otherwise, it updates the previous bit and right shifts `m` to get the next bit.
- If the loop completes without returning false, it means all bits are alternating, so it returns true.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this function is O(log n), where n is the value of `m`, as it iterates through all bits of `m`.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) because it uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
