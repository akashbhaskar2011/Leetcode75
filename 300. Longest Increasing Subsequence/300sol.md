Here's the provided C++ code snippet with added comments:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0; // If the input vector is empty, return 0
        
        vector<int> ans(nums.size(), 1); // Create a DP array 'ans' of size 'nums.size()' and initialize all elements to 1
        int maxans = 1; // Initialize 'maxans' to 1, as the minimum length of the subsequence is 1
        
        // Iterate over the input vector from the second last element to the first one
        for (int i = nums.size() - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            int currentMax = 1; // Initialize 'currentMax' to 1 for the current element 'nums[i]'
            
            // Iterate over the elements from 'i + 1' to the end of the vector
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
                // If the current element is less than the element at index 'j', update 'currentMax' with the maximum value
                if (nums[i] < nums[j]) {
                    currentMax = max(currentMax, ans[j] + 1); // Update 'currentMax' by considering the length of LIS ending at index 'j'
                }
            }
            
            ans[i] = currentMax; // Update the DP array with the maximum length of LIS ending at index 'i'
            maxans = max(maxans, currentMax); // Update 'maxans' with the maximum value
        }
        
        return maxans; // Return the length of the longest increasing subsequence
    }
};
```

### Intuition and Approach:
This function aims to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the given array. It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem efficiently.

### Steps:
1. Check if the input vector `nums` is empty. If so, return 0, as there are no elements to form a subsequence.
2. Create a DP array `ans` of size `nums.size()` and initialize all elements to 1. Each element `ans[i]` represents the length of the LIS ending at index `i`.
3. Initialize `maxans` to 1, as the minimum length of the subsequence is 1.
4. Iterate over the input vector from the second last element to the first one (`i = nums.size() - 2` to `i = 0`):
   - For each element `nums[i]`, initialize `currentMax` to 1.
   - Iterate over the elements from `i + 1` to the end of the vector:
     - If the current element `nums[i]` is less than the element at index `j`, update `currentMax` with the maximum value by considering the length of LIS ending at index `j`.
   - Update the DP array `ans[i]` with the maximum length of LIS ending at index `i`.
   - Update `maxans` with the maximum value.
5. Return `maxans`, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time complexity:** O(n^2), where n is the size of the input vector `nums`. The function iterates over each element of the input vector and performs comparisons for each pair of elements.
- **Space complexity:** O(n), where n is the size of the input vector `nums`. The space complexity is determined by the size of the DP array `ans`.
