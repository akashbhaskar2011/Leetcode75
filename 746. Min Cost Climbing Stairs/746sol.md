Here's the provided C++ code snippet with added comments:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find the minimum cost to reach the top of the stairs
    int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = cost.size(); // Get the size of the cost array
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0); // Create a DP array of size 'n + 1' to store the minimum cost
        
        // Base cases: Initialize the first two elements of the DP array
        dp[0] = cost[0]; // Cost to reach the first step
        dp[1] = cost[1]; // Cost to reach the second step
        
        // Iterate from the third step to the top of the stairs
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            // For each step, choose the minimum cost of reaching the current step
            dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]);
        }
        
        // Return the minimum cost of reaching the top of the stairs
        // The minimum cost can be either reaching the last step or the step before the last step
        return min(dp[n - 1], dp[n - 2]);
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- This function aims to find the minimum cost to reach the top of the stairs by climbing either one or two steps at a time.
- It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem efficiently.
- The DP array `dp` of size `n + 1` is used to store the minimum cost of reaching each step.
- The base cases are initialized with the cost of reaching the first and second steps.
- For each subsequent step, the function calculates the minimum cost of reaching that step by considering the cost of the current step and the minimum cost of reaching the previous two steps.
- Finally, it returns the minimum cost of reaching the top of the stairs, which can be either reaching the last step or the step before the last step.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of steps. The function iterates through all the steps once to calculate the minimum cost.
- **Space complexity:** O(n), as an additional DP array of size n + 1 is used to store the minimum cost of reaching each step.
