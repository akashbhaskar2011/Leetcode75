Here's the provided C++ code snippet with added comments:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find the maximum amount of money that can be robbed
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0; // If the input array is empty, return 0
        
        int n = nums.size(); // Get the size of the input array
        if (n == 1) return nums[0]; // If there is only one house, return its value
        
        vector<int> dp(n, 0); // Create a DP array of size 'n' to store the maximum money
        
        dp[0] = nums[0]; // Base case: Rob the first house
        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1]); // Choose the maximum between robbing the first or second house
        
        // Iterate from the third house to the last one
        for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
            // Choose the maximum between robbing the current house or skipping it
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i]);
        }
        
        return dp[n - 1]; // Return the maximum amount of money that can be robbed
    }
};
```

### Intuition and Approach:
This function aims to find the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from a row of houses, where adjacent houses cannot be robbed simultaneously. It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem efficiently.

### Steps:
1. Check if the input array `nums` is empty. If so, return 0, as there are no houses to rob.
2. Get the size of the input array `nums`.
3. If there is only one house, return its value as it can be robbed.
4. Create a DP array `dp` of size `n` to store the maximum money that can be robbed up to the `i-th` house.
5. Initialize the base cases:
   - Rob the first house and store its value in `dp[0]`.
   - Choose the maximum between robbing the first or second house and store it in `dp[1]`.
6. Iterate from the third house to the last one:
   - For each house `i`, choose the maximum between robbing the current house (`nums[i]`) plus the money robbed up to `i-2`th house (`dp[i-2]`) and skipping the current house (`dp[i-1]`).
   - Update `dp[i]` with the maximum value.
7. Return `dp[n - 1]`, which represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of houses. The function iterates through the input array once to fill the DP array.
- **Space complexity:** O(n), as an additional DP array of size n is used to store the maximum money that can be robbed up to each house.
