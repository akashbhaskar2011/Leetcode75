Below is the breakdown of the provided C++ code snippet with added comments:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxScore(vector<int>& cardPoints, int k) {
        int n = cardPoints.size(); // Get the total number of cards
        int maxi = 0; // Initialize the maximum score
        int curr_sum = 0; // Initialize the current sum
        
        // Calculate the initial sum of the first 'k' cards
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            curr_sum += cardPoints[i];
        }
        
        maxi = curr_sum; // Set the maximum score to the current sum
        
        // Iterate over the 'k' iterations to slide the window
        for (int m = 0; m < k; m++) {
            // Slide the window by subtracting the score of the card leaving the window
            // and adding the score of the card entering the window
            curr_sum -= cardPoints[k - 1 - m];
            curr_sum += cardPoints[n - 1 - m];
            maxi = max(curr_sum, maxi); // Update the maximum score
        }
        
        return maxi; // Return the maximum score
    }
};


class Solution {
public:
    int maxScore(vector<int>& cp, int k) {
        int maxSum = 0, lsum = 0, rsum = 0;
        
        // Calculate initial lsum
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            lsum += cp[i];
        }
        
        maxSum = lsum;
        
        // Traverse the array from k to size()-1
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            lsum -= cp[k - i - 1]; // Remove the last element of the previous window
            rsum += cp[cp.size() - i - 1]; // Add the last element of the current window
            maxSum = max(maxSum, lsum + rsum); // Update maxSum
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
};



```

### Intuition and Approach:
This function calculates the maximum score that can be obtained by selecting cards from either the beginning or the end of the array `cardPoints`. It uses a sliding window approach to iterate through the cards and update the sum of scores in each window.

### Steps:
1. Initialize variables `n`, `maxi`, and `curr_sum` to store the total number of cards, the maximum score, and the current sum, respectively.
2. Calculate the initial sum of the first `k` cards and assign it to `curr_sum`.
3. Set `maxi` to the value of `curr_sum`.
4. Iterate `k` times to slide the window:
   - Subtract the score of the card leaving the window (from the end) and add the score of the card entering the window (from the end).
   - Update `curr_sum` with the new sum.
   - Update `maxi` with the maximum of `curr_sum` and `maxi`.
5. Return `maxi` as the maximum score.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time complexity:** O(k), where `k` is the given parameter representing the number of cards to select. The algorithm iterates over the cards twice, once to calculate the initial sum and once to slide the window.
- **Space complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
