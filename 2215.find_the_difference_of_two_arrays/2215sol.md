Certainly! Here's the commented version of the provided code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    // # Intuition
    // The goal is to find the difference between two sets represented by vectors 'nums1' and 'nums2'. 
    // We use unordered sets 'set1' and 'set2' to store unique elements from 'nums1' and 'nums2', respectively.
    // We iterate through 'set1' and check for elements that are not present in 'set2'. If found, we add
    // those elements to the first vector in the answer 'ans'. Similarly, we iterate through 'set2' and check
    // for elements not present in 'set1'. If found, we add those elements to the second vector in 'ans'.
    // The resulting 'ans' contains two vectors - the first one representing elements present in 'nums1' but not
    // in 'nums2', and the second one representing elements present in 'nums2' but not in 'nums1'.

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> findDifference(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2) {
        // Create unordered sets to store unique elements from nums1 and nums2
        std::unordered_set<int> set1(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
        std::unordered_set<int> set2(nums2.begin(), nums2.end());

        // Create a vector of vectors to store the answer
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> ans(2);

        // Iterate through set1 and check for elements not present in set2
        for (int num : set1) {
            if (set2.find(num) == set2.end()) {
                ans[0].push_back(num);
            }
        }

        // Iterate through set2 and check for elements not present in set1
        for (int num : set2) {
            if (set1.find(num) == set1.end()) {
                ans[1].push_back(num);
            }
        }

        // Return the resulting answer
        return ans;
    }
};
```
