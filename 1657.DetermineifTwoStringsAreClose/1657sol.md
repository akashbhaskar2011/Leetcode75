Certainly! Here's the commented version of the provided code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    // # Intuition
    // The goal is to check if two words are "close" strings. Two words are considered close if they have the same frequency
    // of each character, and they have the same set of characters. We use two vectors 'h1' and 'h2' to count the frequency
    // of each character in the words 'word1' and 'word2'. We iterate through the words and update the counts in the vectors.
    // After that, we check if there is any character that appears in one word but not in the other. If found, return false.
    // Finally, we sort the frequency vectors 'h1' and 'h2' and compare them. If they are equal, the words are "close";
    // otherwise, they are not.

    bool closeStrings(std::string word1, std::string word2) {
        // Check if the words have the same size
        if (word1.size() != word2.size()) {
            return false;
        }

        // Vectors to store the frequency of each character in the words
        std::vector<int> h1(26, 0);
        std::vector<int> h2(26, 0);

        // Count the frequency of each character in the words
        for (int i = 0; i < word1.size(); i++) {
            h1[word1[i] - 'a']++;
            h2[word2[i] - 'a']++;
        }

        // Check if there is any character that appears in one word but not in the other
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if ((h1[i] == 0 && h2[i] > 0) || (h2[i] == 0 && h1[i] > 0)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        // Sort the frequency vectors
        std::sort(h1.begin(), h1.end());
        std::sort(h2.begin(), h2.end());

        // Check if the sorted frequency vectors are equal
        return h1 == h2;
    }
};
```
