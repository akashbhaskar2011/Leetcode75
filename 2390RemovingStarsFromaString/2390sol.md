Here are the two provided solutions with comments explaining their approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    // # Intuition
    // We use a single pointer 'index' to keep track of the position to overwrite characters in the input string 's'.
    // We iterate through each character in the string 's'.
    // If the current character is not '*', we keep it and move it to the position indicated by 'index'.
    // If the current character is '*', we decrement 'index' to remove the last non-'*' character.
    // After processing all characters, we return the substring of 's' up to 'index'.

    string removeStars(string s) {
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s[i] != '*')
                s[index++] = s[i]; // Keep non-'*' characters
            else
                index--; // Remove the last non-'*' character
        }
        return s.substr(0 , index);
    }
};
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <stack>

class Solution {
public:
    // # Intuition
    // We use a stack to keep track of characters to keep in the string.
    // We iterate through each character in the string 's'.
    // If the current character is not '*', we push it onto the stack.
    // If the current character is '*', we pop a character from the stack if it's not empty.
    // After processing all characters, we construct the final string by popping characters from the stack.
    // Since characters are popped in reverse order, we reverse the string after constructing it.
    // Finally, we return the substring of the constructed string without the remaining characters.

    string removeStars(string s) {
        stack<char> st;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if(s[i] != '*') {
                st.push(s[i]); // Keep non-'*' characters
            } else {
                if(!st.empty())
                    st.pop(); // Remove the last non-'*' character
            }
        }
        
        int i = 0;
        while(!st.empty()) {
            s[i++] = st.top(); // Construct the final string by popping characters from the stack
            st.pop();
        }
        
        reverse(s.begin(), s.begin() + i); // Reverse the constructed string
        return s.substr(0, i); // Return the substring of the constructed string
    }
};
```

These versions include comments explaining the intuition and approach of the `removeStars` function. If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, feel free to ask!
