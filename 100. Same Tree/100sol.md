Certainly! Here's the breakdown of the provided C++ code snippet with added comments:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        // If both trees are empty, they are considered the same
        if (p == nullptr && q == nullptr)
            return true;
        
        // If one tree is empty while the other is not, they are not the same
        if (p == nullptr || q == nullptr)
            return false;

        // Check if the current nodes have the same value and recursively check their left and right subtrees
        return ((p->val == q->val) && isSameTree(p->left, q->left) && isSameTree(p->right, q->right));
    }
};
```

### Intuition and Approach:
This function checks if two binary trees represented by the root nodes `p` and `q` are the same. It recursively compares the values of corresponding nodes in both trees, along with their left and right subtrees.

### Steps:
1. If both `p` and `q` are `nullptr`, return `true`, indicating that they are the same.
2. If either `p` or `q` is `nullptr` while the other is not, return `false`, indicating that they are not the same.
3. Compare the values of the current nodes `p` and `q`. If they are equal, recursively check their left and right subtrees.
4. Return the result of the comparison.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time complexity:** \(O(\min(n, m))\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the number of nodes in trees \(p\) and \(q\), respectively. The function traverses each node in both trees exactly once.
- **Space complexity:** \(O(\min(n, m))\) due to the recursive function calls on the call stack, where \(n\) and \(m\) are the heights of trees \(p\) and \(q\), respectively.
