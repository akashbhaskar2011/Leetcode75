Here's the provided function with comments added to explain the logic:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteMiddle(ListNode* head) {
        // Turn off synchronization with standard input/output for performance improvement
        ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
        cin.tie(NULL);
        
        // If the list has only one node
        if (head->next == nullptr) {
            delete head; // Delete the node
            return nullptr; // Return nullptr as the list is now empty
        }
        
        // Initialize two pointers for slow and fast traversal
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;
        ListNode* prev = nullptr; // Pointer to keep track of the previous node
        
        // Traverse the list with fast pointer moving two steps at a time and slow pointer moving one step at a time
        while (fast && fast->next) {
            prev = slow; // Update the previous pointer
            slow = slow->next; // Move slow pointer one step forward
            fast = fast->next->next; // Move fast pointer two steps forward
        }
        
        // Remove the middle node by bypassing it
        prev->next = slow->next; // Update the next pointer of the previous node
        slow->next = nullptr; // Disconnect the middle node from the list
        delete slow; // Delete the middle node
        
        return head; // Return the head of the updated list
    }
};
```

This function deletes the middle node of a linked list by using the slow and fast pointers technique. It iterates through the list with two pointers, where the fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle node. Then, the function bypasses the middle node and deletes it, returning the head of the updated list.
