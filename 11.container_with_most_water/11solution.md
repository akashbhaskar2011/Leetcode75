Certainly! Here's the commented version of the provided code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    // # Intuition
    // The goal is to find the maximum area formed by the heights of the walls. We use the two-pointer approach
    // with pointers 'i' and 'j' representing the left and right walls, respectively. We initialize the variable 'most'
    // to store the maximum area. In each step, we calculate the current area based on the minimum height between the
    // walls ('currentHeight') multiplied by the width ('currentWidth'). We update 'most' with the maximum of its
    // current value and the current area. We then move the pointers towards each other by choosing the shorter wall
    // to potentially find a higher wall.

    int maxArea(std::vector<int>& h) {
        int i = 0, j = h.size() - 1;
        int most = 0;

        while (i < j) {
            // Calculate the current area based on the minimum height between walls and width
            int currentHeight = std::min(h[i], h[j]);
            int currentWidth = j - i;
            int currentArea = currentHeight * currentWidth;

            // Update 'most' with the maximum of its current value and the current area
            most = std::max(most, currentArea);

            // Move the pointers towards each other by choosing the shorter wall
            if (h[i] < h[j]) {
                i++;
            } else {
                j--;
            }
        }

        // Return the maximum area obtained
        return most;
    }
};
```

This version includes comments explaining the intuition and approach of the `maxArea` function.
