Your approach using a map to store Roman numeral mappings is correct and provides an alternative way to implement the conversion from an integer to a Roman numeral. This method also ensures that the numerals are processed from the highest value to the lowest, which is necessary for proper Roman numeral formatting.

Here's a clean version of your code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string intToRoman(int n) {
        map<int, string> m;
        m[1] = "I";   m[4] = "IV";  m[5] = "V";   m[9] = "IX";
        m[10] = "X";  m[40] = "XL"; m[50] = "L";  m[90] = "XC";
        m[100] = "C"; m[400] = "CD"; m[500] = "D"; m[900] = "CM";
        m[1000] = "M";

        auto it = m.rbegin();
        string ans;
        while (n > 0) {
            while (n >= it->first) {
                n -= it->first;
                ans += it->second;
            }
            it++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Map Initialization**:
    - A `map<int, string>` is used to store the Roman numeral values and their corresponding symbols. The map is populated with key-value pairs where the key is the integer value and the value is the Roman numeral string.

2. **Reverse Iterator**:
    - The map is traversed using a reverse iterator (`rbegin()`), ensuring that we start with the highest Roman numeral values.

3. **Conversion Loop**:
    - While `n` is greater than 0, the loop continuously subtracts the highest possible Roman numeral value from `n` and appends the corresponding Roman numeral symbol to the result string `ans`.
    - After subtracting, the iterator is incremented to move to the next lower Roman numeral value.

4. **Return Result**:
    - Once the loop completes and `n` becomes 0, the final Roman numeral string `ans` is returned.

This approach is efficient and leverages the properties of the `map` container for an easy-to-read and maintainable solution.
