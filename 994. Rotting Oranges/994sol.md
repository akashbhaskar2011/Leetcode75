Your implementation of the `orangesRotting` function is quite close to being correct, but there are a few minor issues to address for correctness and clarity:

1. **Day Increment Logic**:
   - The `day` variable should be incremented once per level of BFS (per day), not within the nested loop.
   - It should be incremented after processing all rotten oranges of the current level.

2. **Handling Empty Grid**:
   - If the grid is empty or contains only 0s, you should return 0 immediately.

3. **Queue Pair Initialization**:
   - The rotten oranges queue initialization is correct.

4. **Total Count Check**:
   - Make sure to only increment the count `cnt` when a new orange is being rotted, not just for the initial rotten ones.

Here's the corrected version of the `orangesRotting` function:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int orangesRotting(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0; // Handle empty grid
        int m = grid[0].size();

        queue<pair<int, int>> rotten;
        int total = 0, count = 0, days = 0;

        // Initialize the queue with the positions of the rotten oranges and count the total oranges
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] != 0) total++;
                if (grid[i][j] == 2) {
                    rotten.push({i, j});
                }
            }
        }

        int directions[4][2] = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
        while (!rotten.empty()) {
            int k = rotten.size();
            count += k; // Count the number of rotten oranges processed

            while (k--) {
                auto [x, y] = rotten.front();
                rotten.pop();

                for (auto dir : directions) {
                    int r = x + dir[0];
                    int c = y + dir[1];

                    if (r < 0 || r >= n || c < 0 || c >= m || grid[r][c] != 1) continue;

                    grid[r][c] = 2; // Rot the fresh orange
                    rotten.push({r, c});
                }
            }

            if (!rotten.empty()) days++; // Increment days after processing one level
        }

        return (total == count) ? days : -1;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**:
  - The queue is initialized with all the initial rotten oranges.
  - The total number of non-empty cells (`total`) is counted.

- **BFS Processing**:
  - For each level in the BFS (each day), process all the currently rotten oranges.
  - For each rotten orange, attempt to rot its neighboring fresh oranges.
  - Increment the `days` counter after processing each level, but only if there are more oranges to process.

- **Final Check**:
  - If the count of processed oranges equals the total number of oranges, return the number of days.
  - Otherwise, return -1, indicating that not all oranges can rot.

This approach ensures that the BFS correctly processes each level (day) and counts the minimum days required for all oranges to rot, if possible.
