Here are the modified versions of the provided code snippets with added comments, algorithm intuition, and complexity analysis:

```cpp
// Approach: Using BFS (Breadth-First Search) with a queue to traverse the tree level by level.
// Algorithm Intuition:
// 1. Initialize a queue with the root node and set a counter to 0 to keep track of the depth.
// 2. While the queue is not empty, increment the counter to signify the depth of the tree.
// 3. For each level, iterate through all nodes in the queue (nodes at the same level), popping them out one by one.
// 4. For each popped node, if it has left and/or right children, push them into the queue.
// 5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the queue is empty, counting the levels traversed.
// 6. Return the count as the maximum depth of the tree.
// Complexity Analysis:
// - Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. 
//   Each node is visited once.
// - Space complexity: O(n) in the worst case. In the worst case, the queue can contain all nodes at the lowest level.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        int count = 0;
        TreeNode* temp = root;
        q.push(root);
        if (root == nullptr)
            return 0;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            count++;
            int size = q.size();

            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                temp = q.front();
                q.pop();
                if (temp->left)
                    q.push(temp->left);
                if (temp->right)
                    q.push(temp->right);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

// Approach: Using DFS (Depth-First Search) recursively to find the maximum depth.
// Algorithm Intuition:
// 1. Base case: If the current node is null, return 0.
// 2. Recursively find the maximum depth of the left subtree and the right subtree.
// 3. Return the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees, plus 1 (for the current node).
// 4. This effectively calculates the maximum depth from the bottom up.
// Complexity Analysis:
// - Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. 
//   Each node is visited exactly once.
// - Space complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. 
//   The space complexity is the depth of the recursive call stack.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root)
            return 0;
        int maxLeft = maxDepth(root->left);
        int maxRight = maxDepth(root->right);
        return max(maxLeft, maxRight) + 1;
    }
};
```

These implementations provide two different approaches for finding the maximum depth of a binary tree: BFS and DFS. They have different time and space complexities but achieve the same result.
