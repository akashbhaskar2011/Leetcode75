Below is the provided code with added comments for intuition, approach, and complexity analysis:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.size() - 1; // Initialize low and high pointers for binary search
        while (low <= high) { // Perform binary search until low <= high
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // Calculate the middle index
            int no = nums[mid]; // Get the value at the middle index
            if ((mid == 0 || nums[mid - 1] < no) && (mid == nums.size() - 1 || no > nums[mid + 1]))
                return mid; // If nums[mid] is greater than its neighbors, it's a peak element
            else if (mid > 0 && nums[mid - 1] > no) // If the left neighbor is greater, move left
                high = mid - 1;
            else // If the right neighbor is greater, move right
                low = mid + 1;
        }
        return -1; // No peak element found, return -1
    }
};
```

## Intuition
The problem aims to find any peak element in an array. A peak element is defined as an element that is greater than its neighbors.

## Approach
1. We use binary search to find a peak element efficiently.
2. At each step, we compare the element at the middle index with its neighbors.
3. If the middle element is greater than its neighbors, it's a peak element.
4. If the middle element is less than its left neighbor, we move towards the left side.
5. If the middle element is less than its right neighbor, we move towards the right side.
6. We continue this process until we find a peak element or exhaust the search space.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: \(O(\log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are performing binary search.
- Space complexity: \(O(1)\), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space for variables like `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `no`.
