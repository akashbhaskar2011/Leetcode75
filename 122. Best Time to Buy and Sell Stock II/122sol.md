Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the provided C++ code snippets with added comments for both solutions:

### Solution 1:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.size() < 2)
            return 0; // If there are fewer than 2 prices, return 0 as there's no opportunity for profit
        int ans = 0; // Initialize the maximum profit
        int buy = prices[0]; // Initialize the buying price as the first price in the list
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (buy > prices[i]) // If the current price is lower than the buying price
                buy = prices[i]; // Update the buying price
            else if (i == prices.size() - 1 && prices[i] > buy) // If it's the last day and the price is higher than the buying price
                ans += prices[i] - buy; // Sell at the current price and add the profit to the total profit
            else if (prices[i] > buy && prices[i + 1] < prices[i]) { // If the price is higher than the buying price and the next day's price is lower
                ans += prices[i] - buy; // Sell at the current price and add the profit to the total profit
                buy = prices[i + 1]; // Update the buying price for the next buying opportunity
                i++; // Skip the next day as it's already processed
            }
        }
        return ans; // Return the maximum profit
    }
};
```

### Solution 2:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size(); // Get the number of days
        int ans = 0; // Initialize the maximum profit
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) { // Iterate through the prices till the second last day
            if (prices[i + 1] > prices[i]) // If the price of the next day is higher than the current day
                ans += (prices[i + 1] - prices[i]); // Buy at the current day and sell at the next day, add profit to the total profit
        }
        return ans; // Return the maximum profit
    }
};
```

### Intuition and Approach:
Both solutions aim to find the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling stocks. They use a greedy approach to exploit every opportunity to buy at a lower price and sell at a higher price.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Solution 1:**
  - Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of days or prices. The algorithm iterates through the prices only once.
  - Space complexity: O(1), as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space.

- **Solution 2:**
  - Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of days or prices. The algorithm iterates through the prices only once.
  - Space complexity: O(1), as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space.
