The given C++ code generates Pascal's triangle with 'row' number of rows. Below is the explanation with comments added to the code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> generate(int row) {
        vector<vector<int>> ans; // Initialize a 2D vector to store the Pascal's triangle
        
        // Iterate over each row
        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            // Create a new row with 'i + 1' elements, all initialized to 1
            ans.push_back(vector<int>(i + 1, 1));
        }

        // Iterate over each row starting from the third row (index 2)
        for (int i = 2; i < row; i++) {
            // Iterate over each element of the current row (excluding the first and last elements)
            for (int j = 1; j < i; j++) {
                // Calculate the value of the current element as the sum of the elements from the previous row
                ans[i][j] = ans[i - 1][j - 1] + ans[i - 1][j];
            }
        }

        return ans; // Return the Pascal's triangle
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- The `generate` function generates Pascal's triangle with 'row' number of rows.
- Initially, it creates a 2D vector 'ans' to store the Pascal's triangle.
- It iterates over each row from 0 to 'row - 1' and pushes a new row into 'ans', where each row contains 'i + 1' elements, all initialized to 1.
- Then, it iterates over each row starting from the third row (index 2) and each element of the row (excluding the first and last elements).
- For each element in the middle of the row, it calculates the value by adding the corresponding elements from the previous row.
- Finally, it returns the Pascal's triangle stored in the 'ans' vector.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(row^2), where 'row' is the number of rows in the Pascal's triangle. The function iterates over each row and each element in the rows to generate the triangle.
- **Space Complexity:** O(row^2), as the space required to store the Pascal's triangle is proportional to the number of elements in the triangle.
