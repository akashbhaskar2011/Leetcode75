Your implementation of the `preorderTraversal` function using an iterative approach and a stack is almost correct. However, there is a small mistake in the logic. 

When pushing nodes onto the stack, you should push the right child first and then the left child to ensure that the left child is processed before the right child (since a stack is Last-In-First-Out). This ensures that the nodes are traversed in the preorder manner: root -> left -> right.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return {}; // Handle the case when the root is null

        stack<TreeNode*> st;
        st.push(root);
        vector<int> ans;

        while (!st.empty()) {
            auto curr = st.top();
            st.pop();

            ans.push_back(curr->val); // Visit the current node

            // Push the right child first and then the left child
            if (curr->right) st.push(curr->right);
            if (curr->left) st.push(curr->left);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

In this corrected version:
- We ensure that the root is not null before starting the traversal.
- When pushing nodes onto the stack, we push the right child first and then the left child, ensuring the correct preorder traversal order.
- We visit each node and push its value to the `ans` vector.

This implementation should give you the correct preorder traversal of the binary tree.
