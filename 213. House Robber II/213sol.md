Here's the provided C++ code snippet with added comments:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from houses in a given range [start, end]
    int helper(int start, int end, vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> dp(end, -1); // Create a DP array to store the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to each house
        dp[start] = nums[start]; // Initialize the DP array with the first house value
        dp[start + 1] = max(nums[start], nums[start + 1]); // Initialize the DP array with the second house value
        
        // Iterate from the third house to the end of the range
        for (int i = start + 2; i < end; i++) {
            // Update the DP array with the maximum amount of money that can be robbed either by skipping the current house or by robbing it
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i]);
        }
        // Return the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the last house
        return dp[end - 1];
    }
    
    // Function to calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from all houses
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size(); // Get the total number of houses
        int ans = 0; // Initialize the answer variable
        
        // If there are less than 4 houses, simply return the maximum value among them
        if (n < 4) {
            for (int i : nums)
                ans = max(ans, i);
            return ans;
        }
        
        // Return the maximum amount of money that can be robbed either starting from the first house or the second house
        return max(helper(0, n - 1, nums), helper(1, n, nums));
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- The `rob` function calculates the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from houses in a given neighborhood.
- It utilizes the `helper` function to calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from houses in a specified range `[start, end]`.
- The `helper` function employs dynamic programming to compute the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to each house in the specified range.
- The function iterates through the range of houses, updating the DP array with the maximum amount of money that can be robbed either by skipping the current house or by robbing it.
- Finally, the `rob` function returns the maximum amount of money that can be robbed starting from either the first house or the second house, depending on whether the first or the last house is included.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of houses. Both the `helper` function and the `rob` function iterate through the given range of houses once, resulting in a linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of houses. The space complexity is determined by the DP array used in the `helper` function, which stores the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to each house.
