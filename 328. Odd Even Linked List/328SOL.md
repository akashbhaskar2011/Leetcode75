Below is the provided function with comments added to explain the logic:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* oddEvenList(ListNode* head) {
        // If the list is empty or has only one node, return the head
        if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) {
            return head;
        }
        
        ListNode* odd = head; // Pointer to track odd nodes
        ListNode* even = head->next; // Pointer to track even nodes
        ListNode* evenHead = even; // Pointer to the head of the even list
        
        // Traverse the list and rearrange odd and even nodes
        while (even != nullptr && even->next != nullptr) {
            odd->next = even->next; // Connect odd node to the next odd node
            odd = odd->next; // Move to the next odd node
            even->next = odd->next; // Connect even node to the next even node
            even = even->next; // Move to the next even node
        }
        
        odd->next = evenHead; // Connect the last odd node to the head of the even list
        
        return head; // Return the head of the rearranged list
    }
};
```

This function rearranges a singly-linked list such that all the odd-indexed nodes appear before the even-indexed nodes. It uses three pointers: `odd` to track odd nodes, `even` to track even nodes, and `evenHead` to store the head of the even list. The function iterates through the list, connecting odd and even nodes appropriately, and then links the last odd node to the head of the even list. Finally, it returns the head of the rearranged list.
