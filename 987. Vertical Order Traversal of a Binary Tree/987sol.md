Certainly! Here's the combined code with comments:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

// Define a struct to hold data about each node during traversal
struct Data {
    int xy; // X-coordinate of the node
    int h;  // Height of the node
    TreeNode *node; // Pointer to the node itself
};

vector<Data> datavec; // Vector to store the data of each node during traversal

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> ans; // Final result

    // Helper function for tree traversal
    void helper(TreeNode* root, int xy, int h) {
        if (!root) return; // Base case: if the node is null, return
        datavec.push_back({xy, h, root}); // Push data of the current node into datavec
        helper(root->left, xy - 1, h + 1); // Recursively traverse left subtree with decremented x-coordinate and incremented height
        helper(root->right, xy + 1, h + 1); // Recursively traverse right subtree with incremented x-coordinate and incremented height
    }

    // Comparator function to sort Data structs based on xy, h, and node value
    static bool cmp(const Data& a, const Data& b) {
        if (a.xy != b.xy) return a.xy < b.xy; // Sort by x-coordinate
        if (a.h != b.h) return a.h < b.h;    // If x-coordinate is same, sort by height
        return a.node->val < b.node->val;    // If both x-coordinate and height are same, sort by node value
    }

    // Main function to perform vertical traversal
    vector<vector<int>> verticalTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        datavec.clear(); // Clear datavec to store new traversal data
        ans.clear();     // Clear ans to store new result
        helper(root, 0, 0); // Perform tree traversal starting from the root
        sort(datavec.begin(), datavec.end(), cmp); // Sort the data vector using the defined comparator

        map<int, vector<int>> columns; // Map to store nodes grouped by their x-coordinate
        for (auto& data : datavec) {
            columns[data.xy].push_back(data.node->val); // Group nodes by their x-coordinate
        }

        // Iterate through the map and add node values to the result vector
        for (auto& col : columns) {
            ans.push_back(col.second); // Add node values of each x-coordinate group to ans
        }

        return ans; // Return the final result
    }
};
```

This code appears to be solving the problem of vertical traversal of a binary tree. Here's a breakdown:

## Intuition
The intuition seems to be traversing the tree in a vertical order, collecting nodes based on their x-coordinate (horizontal distance from the root) and height.

## Approach
1. The `helper` function traverses the binary tree in a recursive manner, storing each node's x-coordinate, height, and the node itself in a vector of `Data` structs.
2. After traversal, the vector of `Data` is sorted based on x-coordinate, then height, and finally node value.
3. Using a map, the nodes are grouped by their x-coordinate.
4. Finally, the values of each x-coordinate group are added to the final result vector.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: Traversing the tree takes O(n), sorting the `datavec` takes O(n log n), and grouping nodes by x-coordinate takes O(n). So, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).
- Space complexity: The space complexity is dominated by the `datavec` and the `columns` map, both potentially taking O(n) space. Thus, the space complexity is also O(n).

The code seems clear and concise. However, it's important to ensure that all edge cases are considered, especially regarding the sorting and traversal logic.
