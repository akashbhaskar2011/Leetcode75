Certainly! Here are the formatted explanations for the provided code snippets:

### Code Snippet 605:

```cpp
// To handle address sanitizer by checking index before 0 and after the length
// Check if the left and right spots are also empty or out of bounds
int left = (i == 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) ? 0 : 1;
int right = (i == len - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] == 0) ? 0 : 1;
```

Explanation: This code snippet is part of a flowerbed planting algorithm. It checks if the left and right spots of the current index (`i`) are either empty or out of bounds. This is done to avoid accessing memory before the beginning or after the end of the `flowerbed` array, and it helps in handling address sanitizer warnings.

### Code Snippet 1071:

```cpp
// GCD of strings
// Strings str1 and str2 can have a common GCD only if s1+s2 == s2+s1
// Find the length of both strings and find the GCD of the lengths
// Return the substring up to the length of the GCD

// Check if concatenation in both orders is equal
if ((str1 + str2) != (str2 + str1)) return ""; // If not equal, no common divisor

// Return the substring up to the length of the GCD
return str1.substr(0, gcd(str1.length(), str2.length()));
```

Explanation: This code snippet implements a function for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strings. It checks if the concatenation of the strings in both orders is equal. If they are, it means there is a common divisor, and the function returns the substring up to the length of the GCD. The GCD is determined by finding the GCD of the lengths of the two strings.
