This C++ code defines a function `reverseBits` that takes an unsigned 32-bit integer `n` as input and returns the integer obtained by reversing its bits.

Here's the explanation of the code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    uint32_t reverseBits(uint32_t n) {
        uint32_t ans = 0; // Initialize the result variable to store the reversed bits
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) { // Iterate over each bit in the 32-bit integer
            ans <<= 1; // Left shift the result to make space for the next bit
            
            // Bitwise OR operation with the least significant bit of 'n'
            ans |= (n & 1); 
            
            n >>= 1; // Right shift 'n' to move to the next bit
        }

        return ans; // Return the reversed 32-bit integer
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

- The function starts by initializing a variable `ans` to store the reversed bits of the input `n`.
- It then iterates 32 times, once for each bit in a 32-bit integer.
- Inside the loop:
  - It left shifts `ans` by 1, which effectively moves the existing bits one position to the left to make space for the next bit.
  - It performs a bitwise AND operation between `n` and 1 (`n & 1`). This extracts the least significant bit of `n`.
  - It bitwise ORs the result obtained in the previous step with `ans`. This sets the least significant bit of `ans` to the extracted bit from `n`.
  - It right shifts `n` by 1 to move to the next bit.
- After iterating through all 32 bits, the function returns the reversed 32-bit integer stored in `ans`.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this function is O(1) because it iterates a fixed number of times (32 times for a 32-bit integer), making it constant time.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also O(1) because the function only uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
