Below is the breakdown of the provided C++ code snippet with added comments:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> ans; // Vector to store all subsets
    void helper(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& subset, int i) {
        if (i == nums.size()) { // Base case: If all elements are processed
            ans.push_back(subset); // Add the current subset to the list of subsets
            return;
        }
        
        helper(nums, subset, i + 1); // Exclude the current element and move to the next index
        subset.push_back(nums[i]); // Include the current element in the subset
        helper(nums, subset, i + 1); // Recursively call the function with the next index
        subset.pop_back(); // Backtrack by removing the last element from the subset
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> subsets(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> subset; // Initialize an empty subset
        helper(nums, subset, 0); // Start the recursion from index 0
        return ans; // Return the list of all subsets
    }
};
```

### Intuition and Approach:
This function generates all possible subsets of the given array `nums` using a backtracking approach. It recursively explores two choices for each element in the array: including it in the current subset or excluding it. 

### Steps:
1. Create a helper function `helper` to generate subsets recursively. The function takes the current subset, the input array, and the current index as parameters.
2. In the `helper` function:
   - If all elements are processed (i.e., `i == nums.size()`), add the current subset to the list of subsets and return.
   - Otherwise, recursively call the `helper` function twice for the next index:
     - Exclude the current element and move to the next index.
     - Include the current element in the subset and move to the next index.
     - Backtrack by removing the last element from the subset.
3. Initialize an empty subset and start the recursion from index 0 by calling the `helper` function.
4. Return the list of all subsets.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time complexity:** O(2^n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. Each element has two choices: to be included or excluded in the subset.
- **Space complexity:** O(2^n), as there are 2^n subsets in total and each subset can have at most n elements.
