Your implementations of the `getIntersectionNode` function for finding the intersection node of two singly linked lists are both correct and utilize different methods. I'll provide some additional comments to make each implementation clearer.

### Implementation 1: Using Two Pointers

This implementation uses two pointers to traverse the two linked lists. If one pointer reaches the end, it switches to the beginning of the other list. This ensures that both pointers traverse the same number of nodes, thus meeting at the intersection node if it exists.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        if (headA == NULL || headB == NULL) return NULL;
        
        ListNode *a = headA, *b = headB;
        
        while (a != b) {
            a = (a == nullptr) ? headB : a->next;
            b = (b == nullptr) ? headA : b->next;
        }
        
        return a;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Pointers `a` and `b` are initialized to the heads of `headA` and `headB`, respectively.
2. **Traversal**: Both pointers traverse their respective lists. When one pointer reaches the end of its list, it switches to the head of the other list.
3. **Meeting Point**: The pointers will meet at the intersection node after at most `m + n` steps, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two lists. If no intersection exists, both pointers will eventually become `NULL` simultaneously, and the loop will exit.

### Implementation 2: Using Length Difference

This implementation calculates the lengths of both lists, aligns the starting points, and then traverses the lists together to find the intersection.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *h1, ListNode *h2) {
        ListNode *c1 = h1, *c2 = h2;
        int len1 = 0, len2 = 0;
        
        while (c1 != NULL) {
            len1++;
            c1 = c1->next;
        }
        
        while (c2 != NULL) {
            len2++;
            c2 = c2->next;
        }
        
        int diff = abs(len1 - len2);
        
        c1 = (len1 > len2) ? h1 : h2;
        c2 = (len1 > len2) ? h2 : h1;
        
        while (diff--) {
            c1 = c1->next;
        }
        
        while (c1 != c2) {
            c1 = c1->next;
            c2 = c2->next;
        }
        
        return c1;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Calculate Lengths**: Traverse both lists to calculate their lengths (`len1` and `len2`).
2. **Align Start Points**: Determine the longer list and move its pointer forward by the difference in lengths (`diff`) to align both pointers.
3. **Traverse Together**: Traverse both lists together until the pointers meet at the intersection node or reach the end of the lists.

### Summary

Both methods are efficient, with a time complexity of O(m + n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two lists. The first method (two-pointer technique) is generally simpler and doesn't require extra space for storing lengths. The second method might be easier to understand conceptually because it explicitly aligns the lists before the final traversal. Both approaches are valid and can be chosen based on preference or specific constraints.
