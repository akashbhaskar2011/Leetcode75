The provided C++ code implements the "Two Sum" problem, where you need to find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target. Here's a breakdown of the code with added comments:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int i = 0, j = nums.size() - 1; // Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the array

        while (i < j) { // Continue searching until the pointers meet or cross each other
            if ((nums[i] + nums[j]) == target) // If the sum of elements at current positions equals the target
                return {i + 1, j + 1}; // Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed)
            else if ((nums[i] + nums[j]) > target) // If the sum is greater than the target
                j--; // Move the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum
            else // If the sum is less than the target
                i++; // Move the left pointer to the right to increase the sum
        }
        return {}; // If no such pair is found, return an empty vector
    }
};
```

### Intuition:
The approach uses a two-pointer technique to efficiently find two numbers that add up to the target. By starting with one pointer at the beginning of the array and the other at the end, the algorithm gradually moves the pointers closer together based on the sum of the elements at their positions.

### Approach:
1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, pointing to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. While `i` is less than `j`, do the following:
   - If the sum of elements at indices `i` and `j` equals the target, return the indices of these elements.
   - If the sum is greater than the target, decrement `j` to decrease the sum.
   - If the sum is less than the target, increment `i` to increase the sum.
3. If no such pair is found, return an empty vector.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time complexity:** The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) since it iterates through the array at most once.
- **Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
