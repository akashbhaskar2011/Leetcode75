Certainly! Let's break down the given C++ code to understand its purpose, the algorithm it uses, and the intuition behind it. Additionally, I'll add comments and explain the time and space complexity.

### Purpose
The function `checkSubarraySum` checks whether a given array `nums` contains a contiguous subarray of at least two elements whose sum is a multiple of `k`.

### Intuition
The key idea is to use a prefix sum approach with modulo arithmetic to detect if there is a subarray whose sum is a multiple of `k`. If two prefix sums have the same remainder when divided by `k`, the subarray sum between these two prefix sums is a multiple of `k`.

### Algorithm
1. Use an unordered map `m` to store the first occurrence of each remainder when the cumulative sum is divided by `k`.
2. Initialize the cumulative sum `sum` to 0.
3. Iterate through the array, updating the cumulative sum.
4. Compute the remainder `mod` of the cumulative sum when divided by `k`. Adjust for negative values to ensure the remainder is non-negative.
5. Check if this remainder has been seen before:
   - If it has, check the length of the subarray between the previous occurrence and the current index.
   - If the length is at least 2, return `true`.
6. If the remainder hasn't been seen before, store the current index in the map.
7. If no valid subarray is found, return `false`.

### Code with Comments
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkSubarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int,int> m;  // Map to store the first occurrence of each remainder
        int sum = 0;               // Cumulative sum
        m[0] = -1;                 // Initialize map with remainder 0 at index -1

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            sum += nums[i];             // Update cumulative sum
            int mod = sum % k;          // Compute remainder of sum divided by k

            // Adjust for negative remainders to ensure mod is non-negative
            if (mod < 0) mod += k;

            // Check if this remainder has been seen before
            if (m.find(mod) != m.end()) {
                // Check if subarray length is at least 2
                if (i - m[mod] >= 2) return true;
            } else {
                // Store the index of the first occurrence of this remainder
                m[mod] = i;
            }
        }
        return false; // No valid subarray found
    }
};
```

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm iterates through the array once, performing constant-time operations within the loop.
- **Space Complexity**: O(min(n, k))
  - In the worst case, the unordered map may store up to `min(n, k)` remainders. However, in practice, it is often much smaller due to the modulo operation.

This explanation covers the purpose, intuition, algorithm, and complexity of the given function.
