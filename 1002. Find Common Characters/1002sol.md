Certainly! Here's the modified code with comments explaining the intuition behind each step, as well as an analysis of its time complexity:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> commonChars(vector<string>& words) {
        // Initialize a vector to store the minimum frequency of each character
        // across all words. Set initial values to a high number (INT_MAX).
        vector<int> minfreq(26, INT_MAX);

        // Iterate over each word in the input list of words
        for (auto word : words) {
            // Initialize a frequency vector for the current word
            vector<int> freq(26, 0);

            // Count the frequency of each character in the current word
            for (char c : word) {
                freq[c - 'a']++;
            }

            // Update the minimum frequency vector with the minimum value between
            // the current word's frequency and the previously recorded minimum frequency
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                minfreq[i] = min(freq[i], minfreq[i]);
            }
        }

        // Initialize a vector to store the result
        vector<string> ans;

        // Construct the result based on the minimum frequency of each character
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < minfreq[i]; j++) {
                ans.push_back(string(1, 'a' + i));
            }
        }

        // Return the result
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Intuition
1. **Initialize Minimum Frequencies**: We start by creating a `minfreq` vector initialized to `INT_MAX` to keep track of the smallest frequency of each character across all words. This ensures that any character not present in any word will result in zero occurrences in the final result.
  
2. **Count Frequencies for Each Word**: For each word in the input list, we count the frequency of each character and store it in a temporary `freq` vector.

3. **Update Minimum Frequencies**: After computing the frequency of each character for a word, we update the `minfreq` vector by comparing it with the `freq` vector and keeping the minimum values. This step ensures that `minfreq` holds the lowest frequency of each character seen so far across all words.

4. **Construct the Result**: Using the `minfreq` vector, we construct the final result. For each character, we append it to the result list as many times as its minimum frequency recorded in `minfreq`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Counting the frequency of characters in each word takes \(O(n \cdot m)\), where \(n\) is the number of words and \(m\) is the average length of the words.
  - Updating the `minfreq` vector takes \(O(n \cdot 26)\) = \(O(n)\), as there are 26 letters in the alphabet.
  - Constructing the result takes \(O(26 \cdot k)\), where \(k\) is the average minimum frequency of characters (usually a small constant).

  Combining these, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \cdot m)\), which is efficient given the problem constraints.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - We use two fixed-size vectors of size 26 (one for `minfreq` and one for `freq`), leading to \(O(26)\) = \(O(1)\) space complexity.
  - The space complexity for the result vector depends on the output size but is generally \(O(n \cdot m)\) in the worst case where each character in each word is common.
